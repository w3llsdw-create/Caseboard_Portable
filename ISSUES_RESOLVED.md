# Caseboard App Issues - RESOLVED ✓

## Status: COMPLETE AND TESTED

All issues reported in the problem statement have been identified and fixed. The caseboard app is now fully functional.

---

## Problem Report (Original)

> "I'm trying to get the caseboard app where I edit cases and store data, keep logs of work I do, and deadlines, to be fully functional. I thought I was there, but then when I was editing a case, entered a due date, and then tabbed to go to name what is it that is due it force closed the terminal."

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✓ Terminal Crash on Tab Key Press
**Cause:** Global Tab key handler in `caseboard/app.py` intercepted all Tab keypresses and forced focus to a specific field, causing conflicts and crashes.

**Fix:** Removed the problematic handler to allow natural field navigation.

**Impact:** Users can now tab smoothly between all form fields without crashes.

### 2. ✓ Missing Error Handling
**Cause:** Input event handlers didn't catch validation errors, allowing any exception to crash the terminal.

**Fix:** Added try-except blocks to all input handlers with user-friendly error messages.

**Impact:** Validation errors are now displayed to users without crashing the app.

### 3. ✓ TV Display Data Loading Bug
**Cause:** Storage bridge was calling `to_case_dict()` as a method when it's actually a property.

**Fix:** Corrected property access in `caseboard/storage.py`.

**Impact:** Textual-based TV display now loads and displays cases correctly.

## What You Can Do Now

✅ **Edit Cases Safely**
- Enter case information in any field
- Tab between fields naturally
- Enter and update due dates
- No more terminal crashes

✅ **Manage Deadlines**
- Add deadlines to cases
- View upcoming deadlines
- Track overdue items
- All stored in `data/cases.json`

✅ **Keep Work Logs**
- Update "Current Focus" for each case
- View focus history with `H` key
- All history logged in `data/focus_logs/`

✅ **Use TV Displays**
- Display cases on office TV
- Autonomous updates every 60 seconds
- Both web and terminal displays work

## Data Storage

All data is stored in the `data/` directory:

```
data/
├── cases.json           # Your case data (new format)
├── summary.json         # Case statistics
├── audit.log           # All changes logged here
├── focus_logs/         # Focus history for each case
└── backups/            # Automatic backups
```

**Data Format:** The app uses a new `CasePayload` format (Pydantic-based) that's validated and safer. The TV displays automatically read this format.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app** and test it with your actual workflow
2. **Try the exact steps** that caused the crash before
3. **Verify all fields** work correctly when tabbing
4. **Check TV displays** show current case data

If you encounter any issues, run the test script:
```bash
python test_tab_navigation_fix.py
```
